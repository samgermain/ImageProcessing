A Histogram of Curvature scale was used to classify leaf shapes; by determining how convex or concave each position on the image is. 

This curvature shows the varying curvature values for an image when measuring with circles of different radii.

Leaves of the same kind typically show similar curvature graphs, so these curvature values were combined with a K nearest neighbors classifier in order to group similar images together and classify the leaves by type.

The classifier was able to classify leaf types with an accuracy of 88%
