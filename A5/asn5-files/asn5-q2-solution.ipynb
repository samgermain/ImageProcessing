    "# Step 1: Compute the texture descriptions for the training images.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each training image, calculate a vector of GLCM features.  Which GLCM features and the set of displacements you choose to you use are up to you (note that displacements for `skimage.feature.graycomatrix()` need to be specified by distances and angles in radians rather than change in x and y directions).  Experiment to obtain the best possible classification rate.  Use conservative choices to begin with until everything is working, then come back and experiemnt.  As described in the Topic 10 lecture notes, use `skimage.feature.graycomatrix()` and `skimage.feature.graycoprops()` to calculate GLCM features.  You'll probably want to use `normed=True` with `graycomatrix`.  Your GLCM features should be stored as a 120-row array by m-element array, (m will depend on how many different features and displacements you used and whether or not you combine values for different displacements or not, e.g., by taking their mean).  \n",
    "\n",
    "_Hint: Pay close attention to the format of the return values of  `graycomatrix()` and `graycoprops()`._\n",
    "\n",
    "For each training image, calculate the rotationally invariant LBP features using `skiamge.feature.local_binary_pattern()`.  You can experiment with parameters `P` and `R` to get a good classification rate, but probably `P=8` and `R=1` are good enough.   For the `method` parameter, use `'uniform'` which gives you the LBP flavour we talked about in class.   Remember that `skiamge.feature.local_binary_pattern()` returns an \"LBP Image\", which is an image in which the pixel value is between 0 and 9, and corresponds to one of the ten possible pattern labels.  It's up to you to turn the \"LBP Image\" into a 10-bin histogram, which serves as the feature vector for that image (you can use `numpy.histogram` for this but again remember to specify `bins` and `range` parameters, and that it returns two things, and you only need the first one). \n",
    "\n",
    "Addionally, calculate the LBP variance feature again using `skimage.feature.local_binary_pattern()` but use `method='var'` instead.  This is the VAR feature we saw in class.  Use the same P and R as before.  Build a 16-bin histogram of the resulting 'LBP-VAR' image; use `range=(0,7000)` with `numpy.hisotgram()` (this is not quite \"correct\", but it's good enough).  Concatenate these with the rotationally invariant LBP features so that you have a 26-element feature vector for each training image.   These should be stored as a 120-row, 26-column array.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this all in one loop which builds both feature arrays.\n",
