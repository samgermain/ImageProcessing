Use the `color_dot_product()` function (provided) to compute the necessary dot products to obtain gxx, gyy, and gxy.  Return an array containing the gradient magnitudes for each pixel, i.e. a graident magnitude image.  Optionally, return a second array containing the gradient directions for each pixel.\n",
